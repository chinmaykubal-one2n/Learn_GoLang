### ðŸ”„ Big Picture First:

OpenTelemetry = standard for collecting **traces**, **metrics**, and **logs** from your app and **sending them somewhere useful** (like SigNoz, Prometheus, etc.).

### ðŸ“¦ Core OpenTelemetry Components Explained

| Term                          | What it is (Simple)                                                               | Why it matters                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instrumentation SDK**       | Library you add to your app (e.g., Go SDK) to auto/generate traces, metrics, logs | This is what adds the observability data (traces/metrics/logs) to your app         |
| **Exporter**                  | Sends the data (traces/metrics/logs) from your app **to another place**           | Your app doesnâ€™t store data â€” it exports it to a backend like the OTel Collector   |
| **OTel Collector**            | A central data pipeline â€” receives, processes, and forwards observability data    | It acts as a buffer, filter, transformer, and router. Think of it as a **gateway** |
| **Receiver**                  | A part of the Collector that **accepts data** from exporters (like your app)      | The app exports â†’ Receiver ingests                                                 |
| **Processor**                 | Modifies or enhances data inside the Collector (e.g., batching, filtering)        | Helps optimize data before forwarding it                                           |
| **Exporter (Collector side)** | Sends data from the Collector to tools like SigNoz, Prometheus, etc.              | E.g., Collector â†’ ClickHouse (SigNoz's storage)                                    |
| **Backend**                   | The final destination for the data (e.g., SigNoz, Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.)       | This is where you analyze and visualize your data                                  |
| **OTLP**                      | OpenTelemetry Protocol â€” the standard protocol used to send data                  | Most modern exporters use OTLP (e.g., `localhost:4317` for gRPC)                   |

### ðŸ”§ A Simple Flow with SigNoz:

```text
Your Go App
 â””â”€> OTel SDK (instrumentation)
      â””â”€> OTLP Exporter (e.g., sends to localhost:4317)
           â””â”€> OTel Collector (receives, processes, exports)
                â””â”€> ClickHouse DB (used by SigNoz)
                     â””â”€> SigNoz UI (you see traces/metrics/logs)
```

---

### ðŸ§  Example in Context:

* You instrument your API code with OpenTelemetry.
* You set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=localhost:4317`
* That means:
  ðŸ”¹ your app is sending traces to the **Collector**
  ðŸ”¹ Collector receives them via **OTLP receiver**
  ðŸ”¹ Then it **batches** and **exports** them to **ClickHouse**
  ðŸ”¹ SigNoz reads from ClickHouse and shows them in the dashboard.
